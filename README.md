# senti
A sentiment analysis enhanced real time search UI and trend tracker

To run our project, clone the repository locally and navigate into the Final folder. From here, you can run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (pip3 for Mac). Next run 'flask run' to deploy. Enter a query to see the top 10 results from news.google.com for the query with sentiment analysis scores (note that both polarity and subjectivity have been scaled to range from 0 to 1), images, and links.
